  "AquacultureGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 1312 aquaculture and fisheries production manager actor.
  Wired as its own `:govern` node in `aquaculture-management.actor`'s
  StateGraph, downstream of `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of
  site provenance or anomaly/supply risk, so this MUST be a separate
  system able to reject a proposal (itonami actor pattern, per
  ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. site provenance      — the request's site must be registered
                              and verified.
    2. no-actuation         — proposal :effect must be :propose.
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off, per
  the README robotics-premise: stock/water-quality anomalies and significant
  supply decisions always require human sign-off):
    3. :op :flag-stock-anomaly (always escalates).
    4. :op :order-supplies with cost >= `supply-cost-threshold`.
    5. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
